Report on AI-Based Intrusion & Behaviour Anomaly Detector 

Problem Statement

Modern digital infrastructures face increasingly advanced cybersecurity threats that often bypass 
traditional rule-based security systems. Attackers now rely on behavioural spoofing, credential theft,
automated bot activity, session hijacking, and distributed intrusion techniques that blend into normal 
system operations. As an organization grows, its servers generate massive volumes of behavioural and 
activity logs—from login attempts and device details to network movements and system actions.
Traditional monitoring tools are not equipped to analyse these logs in real time or detect subtle 
behavioural deviations. Security teams cannot manually review such large datasets, nor can they 
consistently identify complex patterns that indicate intrusions. This gap creates vulnerabilities 
where attacks can progress unnoticed.
To solve this challenge, an automated, real-time anomaly detection and response system is 
required—one that leverages AI to learn normal behaviour, detect anomalies instantly, and 
trigger protective actions. The proposed solution integrates AI-based detection, an MCP Server 
pipeline, automated response logic, and a comprehensive dashboard to give security teams complete 
visibility and control.

Solution Overview

The system creates a continuous security workflow that collects logs, analyses behaviour, 
detects anomalies, performs mitigation, and reports results in real time.
It consists of five core components:

Dashboard Interface
Log Analysis Engine
AI Anomaly Detection Model
MCP Server (Model Context Protocol)
Automated Response Algorithm

Together, these components provide a fully automated intrusion detection and response mechanism 
with human oversight.

Dashboard Interface:

The dashboard serves as the central monitoring and control panel for security analysts. 
Built with modern web technologies such as React supported by
backend frameworks Express and Node.js, the dashboard enables real-time visibility.

Key capabilities include:

• Real-time alerts: Displays high-severity warnings from the AI detection system.
• Live activity feed: Streams user actions, login attempts, and anomaly indicators.
• Notification system: Sends email, SMS, or push alerts for critical incidents.
• Response tracking: Logs automated actions such as IP blocking or MFA enforcement.
• Human review: Allows analysts to approve, override, or escalate system decisions.

The dashboard ensures human operators remain informed and can intervene whenever necessary,
maintaining a balance between automation and oversight.

Log Analysis and Behaviour Tracking:
Logs from multiple system components are continuously collected to build a behavioural timeline. 
Sources include:

Authentication attempts
Device fingerprints
Keystroke patterns and typing speed
Network movements and IP switching
Session metadata
System-level events

This log stream feeds into the AI model and is also used to define behavioural baselines. 
Over time, the system learns what “normal” looks like for each user or device. Any deviation from 
these patterns becomes grounds for anomaly detection.

AI Model for Behaviour-Based Intrusion Detection:
The AI model is the intelligence layer of the system. Instead of relying on static rules, 
it learns behavioural signatures using historical data. It continuously evaluates real-time logs and
compares them to baseline patterns.

The model detects anomalies such as:

• Impossible travel
• Device mismatch
• Bot-like typing behaviour
• Suspicious network changes
• Brute-force patterns
• Privilege escalation attempts
When an anomaly is detected, the model produces a structured output that includes severity level, 
flagged behaviours, and reasoning.

MCP Server (Model Context Protocol):

The MCP Server acts as the communication and processing backbone.
Its core responsibilities include:

• Data transport: Receives logs from system components and streams them to the AI model.
• AI integration: Sends telemetry to the AI engine and receives severity classification.
• Trigger generation: For HIGH-severity incidents, it activates the automated response algorithm.

Routing logic:

• LOW / MEDIUM severity → logged into the database
• HIGH severity → response algorithm triggered and dashboard alerted

The MCP architecture supports scaling, allowing distributed AI processing and modular growth.

Automated Response Algorithm

When the MCP Server flags an event as HIGH severity, the Automated Response Algorithm determines 
the appropriate defensive action. Possible responses include:

• Blocking the user’s IP
• Enforcing MFA
• Invalidating active sessions
• Temporarily disabling the user account
All actions are logged, timestamped, and displayed on the dashboard. Analysts retain the option to
reverse, modify, or escalate automated responses.

Conclusion

The system delivers an end-to-end AI-driven intrusion detection and response workflow.
 By combining behavioural analysis, intelligent logging, automated mitigation, and a comprehensive 
 dashboard, the solution greatly strengthens an organization’s security posture. It reduces detection 
 time, increases accuracy, and ensures continuous monitoring while preserving human oversight. 
 This approach provides a powerful defence against modern behavioural and system-level threats, 
  enabling resilient protection across digital infrastructures.

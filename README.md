AI-Based Intrusion & Behaviour Anomaly Detection System

This project implements an AI-driven security system designed to detect behavioural anomalies and potential intrusions in real time.
It collects logs from multiple sources, analyses user behaviour, identifies suspicious patterns, and triggers automated security responses. 
The architecture includes an AI Model, MCP Server, Log Analysis Engine, Automated Response Algorithm, and a monitoring Dashboard. 
Together, they provide a complete end-to-end detection workflow with human oversight. The system improves security visibility, reduces response time, 
and strengthens protection against modern threats through intelligent behavioural analysis and automated mitigation.
